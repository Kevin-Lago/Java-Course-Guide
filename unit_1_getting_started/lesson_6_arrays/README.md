## Arrays

- An array is a data structure that can hold a fixed number of data values of the same data type.
- Data values in the array are called elements.
- We can think of Arrays as a list. For example a list of car brands
	- Toyota
	- Ford
	- Chrysler

## Declaring Arrays

- In Java you define the data type of the array when it's declared.
- We tell Java we are creating an Array with [].

```java
// This is an array of String(s)
String[] exampleStringArrayDeclaration;

// This is an array of int(s)
int[] exampleIntArrayDeclaration;
```

## Initializing Arrays

- The length of an array is specified when instantiated/initialized.
- Once the length of the array is specified it can not be changed.

## Array Elements

- The location of each element is indicated by a numerical index.
- The elements in an array are ordered.

```java
String[] listOfFruits = { "apples", "bananas", "oranges", "peaches" }
```

| Element   | index |
| ----------|:-----:|
| "apples"  | 0     |
| "bananas" | 1     |
| "oranges" | 2     |
| "peaches" | 3     |

```java
int[] listOfNumbers = { 3, 1, 2, 0 }
```

| Element | index |
| --------|:-----:|
| 3       | 0     |
| 1       | 1     |
| 2       | 2     |
| 0       | 3     |

```java
String[] stringArray = new String[4];
```

| Element | index |
| --------|:-----:|
| null    | 0     |
| null    | 1     |
| null    | 2     |
| null    | 3     |

```java
String[] stringArray = new String[4];
stringArray[0] = "define";
stringArray[1] = "value";
stringArray[2] = "at";
stringArray[3] = "index";
```

| Element  | index |
| ---------|:-----:|
| "define" | 0     |
| "value"  | 1     |
| "at"     | 2     |
| "index"  | 3     |

## Loops and Arrays

- To access all the elements individually we can use Loops!

## Activities

- Create Arrays of different Data Types
- Access and change elements at a specific index
- Loop through those arrays
