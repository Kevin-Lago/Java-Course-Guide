## History of Java

- Java was originally named Greentalk. It was created by James Gosling and his team, Green Team, in 1991 at Sun Microsystems.
- Greentalk was then changed to Oak and finally Java in 1995.
- In 2006 Java was made open sourced by Sun Microsystems.
- In 2010 Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems. Oracle split Java and named the open sourced version OpenJDK, and their own as OracleJDK.

## JRE and JDK

- The Java Runtime Environment or [JRE](https://github.com/Kevin-Lago/Java-Course-Guide/tree/unit1/unit_1_getting_started/#JRE) basically runs Java programs.
- The Java Development Kit or JDK is essentially a set of tools to create Java applications.

## IDEs

- Where the magic happens.
- Integrated Development Environments or IDEs are basically a super text editor.
- IDEs have features and tools that makes creating software easier.
- There're several IDEs you could use.
- I recommend [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to start.
